                    Hi! My name is Lex and I'm a 21 year old junior full-stack web dev and computer science student, 
                    currently located in Datyona Beach, FL (Looking to relocate to Jacksonville).
                    I've been tinkering with raspberry pis and programming since I was in highschool, and now I'm turing that old hobby into a career.
                    <br/>
                    When I was six my parents bought me a first generation PlayStation and that was the part where I became a huge nerd.
                    Ever since, I've been fascinated by art, technology, and any other inbetweens, and have strived to live in that world.    
                    I aim to create stellar projects, adapt to whatever the situation calls, and to animate visions that capture others the same way they did me.
                </p>
